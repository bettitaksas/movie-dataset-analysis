# Movie Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between movie budget, production companies, and gross revenue using the dataset from Kaggle titled "Movies Dataset". I was using Python along with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries for data analysis and visualization. This project includes some data cleanup and housekeeping, EDA, as well as numerization and plotting data on graphs.

## Dependencies

## Hypothesis

1. Budget size correlates with revenue
2. Company correlates with revenue

## Conclusion

1. Budget and revenue have a correlation coefficient of 0.750157, indicating a moderately strong positive correlation.  
This suggests that as the budget size increases, the revenue tends to increase as well.  
The conclusion is that there is evidence supporting the hypothesis that budget size correlates with revenue, as indicated by the moderately strong positive correlation coefficient between the two variables. However, correlation does not imply causation, so while there is a relationship between budget and revenue, other factors could also be influencing revenue. Further analysis would be needed to establish causality.  

2. A correlation coefficient of approximately 0.157 suggests a weak positive correlation between the 'company' and 'gross' variables. This indicates that there is some positive relationship between the company and revenue, but it's not very strong.  
It's essential to interpret this result cautiously, as it could be influenced by various factors such as how 'company' is represented in the dataset, the nature of the data, or other underlying factors affecting revenue.  
Further investigation, such as exploring other variables or conducting additional analyses, may be necessary to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the company and revenue. Additionally, domain knowledge about the companies involved could provide valuable context for interpreting this correlation coefficient.
